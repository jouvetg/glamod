    "## Ice Deformation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Glen's flow law\n",
    "\n",
    "Ice is often considered a non-Newtonian fluid, meaning that its flow behavior is not linear with respect to stress. This unique characteristic is primarily due to ice's crystalline structure and the way it deforms under stress. Glen's flow law provides a mathematical description of this behavior, quantifying how ice flow is related to stress. According to Glen’s law, the ice strain rate $ \\dot{\\epsilon} $ is proportional to the applied stress $ \\tau $ raised to a power n=3, expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\dot{\\epsilon} = A \\tau^n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $ A $ is a temperature-dependent flow parameter, its unit is $Pa^{-3} \\, y^{-1} $. Glen's exponent is very commonly taken as n=3. This non-linear relation illustrates that as stress increases, the rate of ice deformation also increases but at an accelerating rate, which is a fundamental concept in understanding ice dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Glen's flow law, together with the momentum conservation equations, yields a set of Stokes equations, which can be solved to derive the ice flow velocity of an ice body subject to gravitational deformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA) is a simplification of the Stokes equation that applies to ice flow in regions where the ice thickness is much smaller than its horizontal extent. This approximation is particularly useful for modeling ice sheets and glaciers, as it assumes that the vertical shear stress is negligible compared to the gravitational forces acting on the ice. Consequently, the SIA focuses on the balance between the driving stress from the surface slope and the resisting stress due to the ice's weight and friction at the base. The velocity of ice flow under the SIA can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u (z) = -\\frac{A}{2} \\left( \\rho g \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} \\right)^3 \\left( h^4 - (h -z)^4 \\right), \\qquad (1) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ u $ is the ice velocity, $ h $ is the ice thickness, $ \\rho $ is the ice density, $ g $ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $ \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} $ is the slope of the ice surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sketch of code implements the SIA formula (1) and allows us to visualize the ice velocity along the ice thickness as a function of depth $z$, ice thickness $h$, surface slope $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}$, $A$ ice softness parameter. Run the code for different parameters of $A$, $h$, and slope $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}$, and check at how the ice velocity profile change.\n",

    "## Mass Conservation\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of mass conservation is fundamental in fluid dynamics and applies to the evolution of ice sheets as well. In the context of ice flow, mass conservation asserts that the rate of change of ice thickness over time is equal to the difference between the ice accumulation and ablation. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} = SMB(z) \\qquad (2) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ h $ is the ice thickness, $q= \\int_b^s u dz$ is the ice flux, and $ SMB(z) $ is the Surface Mass Balance term representing accumulation minus ablation, $t$ is time, and $x$ is the distance along the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ice sheet evolution equation\n",
    "\n",
    "When combining the Shallow Ice Approximation (1), which relates the flux $ q $ to the ice thickness and the slope of the ice surface, with the mass conservation equation (2), we obtain a nonlinear diffusive equation (given here in one dimension) that predicts the evolution of the geometry of an ice sheet, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} =  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( D(h) \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} \\right) + SMB(z), \\qquad (3) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h$ is the ice thickness, $D(h)$ is the dynamic diffusivity of the ice defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D(h) = \\frac{2 A}{5} (\\rho g)^3 h^5 \\left( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} \\right)^2. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numerical solving\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation (3) must be solved numerically for doing the experiments proposed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that purpose, the code below \"discretizes\" (3) using finite differences to approximate the time derivative, this yields to the following update rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h^{n+1} = h^{n} + dt \\left(  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( D(h^n) \\frac{\\partial z^n}{\\partial x} \\right) + SMB^n(z) \\right), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we compute the ice thickness variable $h$ at time $t^0$, $t^1$, $t^2$, ..., $t^n$, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "The same way, the domain of the glacier is discretized into small intervall, $x^0$, $x^1$, ..., $x^m$, ... and the ice thickness evolution is computed only at these points of the discretization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Climate\n",
    "\n",
    "The snow accumulation budget (which turns into ice) at altitude and ice melt depends on precipitation and temperature. This mass balance $SMB(z)$ is commonly defined as a function of altitude (next figure to the right) and depends on three factors: \n",
    "\n",

    "- 2) a maximum value for accumulation $b_\\mathrm{max}$, \n",
    "- 3) the altitude of the equilibrium line $z_\\mathrm{ELA}$ beyond which ice accumulates and below which ice melts. \n",
    "\n",
