- Teacher: Guillaume Jouvet (guillaume.jouvet (at) unil.ch) 

Salle Géopolis 2224, wednesday from 8.30 to 10.00

# Course objective

The goal of this course is to provide an overview of basic physical processes that governs the evolution of mountain glaciers, and learn how to model them with a numerical model. This course is highly experience driven, using the Instructed Glacier Model, to perfom numerical experiences.

# Content:

- **Introduction :** Basics of glacier processes and numerical model
- **Mini-project :** Model your own Glacier
- **Notebook 1 :** Getting familiar with a simple numerical glacier model
- **Notebook 2 :** Getting familiar with IGM
- **Notebook 3 :** Model Glacier du Mont Miné, calibration to OSL data (Course on "Dates and Rates of landscape evolution", G. King and C. Schmidt)

# Further Ressources

- If there is one ressource to remember is the awesome website : https://www.antarcticglaciers.org that can allow you to deepen the processes.

- To dive more into the mechanics and the maths, I recommend the "Karthaus Summer School Lecture Notes": https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-42584-5

# Computers and tools

- **Use your own computer** to perform computations. This requires: 1) a Python editor (like VS Code), and 2) Python and Anaconda to create a Python environment. You may follow the installation steps here: https://jouvetg.github.io/modnum/00_install/00_install.html. Installing IGM is a bit more complicated, but once done, it is easier to perform your computations locally. To that aim, follow instructions on the IGM webpage : https://igm-model.org/.

- **Use Colab** to do all your computations online. This is much easier at first, as there is nothing to install, but it is less flexible since you need to upload and download data and results.
