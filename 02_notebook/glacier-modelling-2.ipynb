IGM is especially computationally efficient thanks to the TensorFlow library, mathematical operations are fully-vectorized. This permits important speed-ups on [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) (Graphics Processing Units), which are devices made of many processors, and can therefore perform highly-parallelized computations.\n",
